##Project background

This framework has been developed during the Google Summer of Code 2011, for KDE.
It allows designers to collect information about userâ€™s experiences and usability problems with software by attaching small surveys to events or services.

The development is in C++ and respects the KDE's library code policies
(especially it implements Shared D-Pointers
 http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Library_Code_Policy/Shared_D-Pointer_Example).

It requires both KDE and Boost libraries.

##What has been done?

- Parsing and generating CSV files.
- Management of the objects related to the survey and to the different types of questions

##What needs to be done?

The main thing left to do is to port the previous version of the notification survey at git://anongit.kde.org/notificationsurvey to this framework.
